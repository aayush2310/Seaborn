Relational plots are used to perform multivariate analysis:-
1)Scatter Plot
2)Line Plot(specifically used for time-series data)
3)FacetGrids(Plotting multiple graphs side by side)

Scatterplot:-
The scatterplot is a mainstay of statistical visualization.It depicts the joint distribution of two variables using a cloud of points,where each point represents an 
observation in the dataset.This depiction allows eye to infer a substantial amount of information about whether there is any meaningful relationship between them.

scatterplot can be plotted for both numerical and categorical data,but used mostly for numerical data.

Two ways to draw scatterplot in seaborn:-
1)relplot(Figure level Function)
2)scatterplot(Axes level Function)
